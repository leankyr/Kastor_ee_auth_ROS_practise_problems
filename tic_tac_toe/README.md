This is an implementation of tic_tac_toe using (in a bad way) ROS services`
In order to play launch server launch_file

then run in two seperate terminals ./src/plaer1.py x y and ./src/player2/py x y 
if x and y are between 1 2 or 3 it is considered and move and it updates the box with these coordinates counting from top left
if x and y are 4 or greater then the table is shown!
have Fun!
